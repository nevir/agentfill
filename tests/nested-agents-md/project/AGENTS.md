# Project-Specific Agent Instructions

This is a nested AGENTS.md file for testing nested directory support.

## 🚨 PROJECT-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS 🚨

**THESE INSTRUCTIONS OVERRIDE THE ROOT AGENTS.MD:**

1. **FILE HEADER RULE**: When creating markdown files in this project directory, use this header instead:
   ```
   <!-- Project-specific file created by AI Agent -->
   ```

2. **PROJECT SECRET CODE**: When asked "What is the project secret code?", respond with: `NESTED_PROJECT_CODE_99`

3. **PROJECT NAME**: When asked about the project name, respond with: `NestedTestProject`

4. **PREFERRED LANGUAGE**: When asked about programming language preferences, suggest "TypeScript" as the primary language.

## About This Nested File

This file tests whether AI agents can correctly discover and apply instructions from AGENTS.md files in subdirectories, and whether they properly prioritize nested AGENTS.md files over root-level ones when working in a subdirectory context.

		This project uses AGENTS.md files to provide scoped instructions based on the
		file or directory being worked on.

		This project has the following AGENTS.md files:

		<available_agentsmd_files>
		$agent_files
		</available_agentsmd_files>

		NON-NEGOTIABLE: When working with any file or directory within the project:

		1. Load ALL AGENTS.md files in the directory hierarchy matching that location
		   BEFORE you start working on (reading/writing/etc) the file or directory. You
		   do not have to reload AGENTS.md files you have already loaded previously.

		2. ALWAYS apply instructions from the AGENTS.md files that match that location.
		   When there are conflicting instructions, apply instructions from the
		   AGENTS.md file that is CLOSEST (most specific) to that location. More
		   specific instructions OVERRIDE more general ones.

		   Precedence order (from lowest to highest priority):
		   - Global AGENTS.md (~/AGENTS.md) - lowest priority
		   - Project root AGENTS.md (./AGENTS.md)
		   - Nested AGENTS.md files - highest priority (closest to the file)

		   <example>
		     Project structure:
		       ~/AGENTS.md          (global)
		       ./AGENTS.md               (project root)
		       subfolder/
		         file.txt
		         AGENTS.md               (nested)

		     When working with "subfolder/file.txt":
		       - Instructions from "subfolder/AGENTS.md" take highest precedence
		       - Instructions from "./AGENTS.md" override global
		       - Instructions from "~/AGENTS.md" apply only if not overridden
		   </example>

		3. If there is a root ./AGENTS.md file, ALWAYS apply its instructions to ALL
		   work within the project, as everything you do is within scope of the project.
		   Precedence rules still apply for conflicting instructions.
